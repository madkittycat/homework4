            <h2>Yarn</h2>
                <h3>Wool</h3>
                    <p>Wool is the most common yarn used in the fiber arts and is easily accessible in the larger market. There are many 
                        varieties of wool, all of which are derived from sheep. Variations in texture, care, and cost depend on the breed of sheep used to make the yarn. Wool can be used for nearly any
                        project but is often preferred for warm, fitted sweaters, heavy heirloom blankets, and other prized garments and accessories.
                    </p>
                <h3>Cashmere</h3>
                    <p>Soft and warm with great drape, cashmere is considered one of the most luxurious fibers within the crochet world. It comes from the
                        undercoat of “Kashmir” goats in South Asia. These goats only shed once per year and produce a very small amount of fiber. As such, cashmere is often blended
                        with other animal fibers. Add a touch of elegance to your accessory collection with a pair of cashmere gloves or a hat.
                    </p>
                <h3>Mohair</h3>
                    <p>This fluffy yarn is seeing a resurgence and Im 100% here for it. Mohair is derived from Angora goats (not to be confused 
                        with Angora rabbits!). Used on its own or held double with another yarn, mohair adds an interesting level of texture
                        and warmth. Add a strand of mohair to handmade sweaters or winter accessories to bring a touch of whimsy to everyday items.
