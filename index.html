            <h2>A crochet hook</h2>
            <p>Crochet hooks are a great tool 
            for picking up dropped stitches and, who knows, maybe even giving crochet a go. Also crochet hook is a tool used to create loops 
            in thread or yarn and to interlock them into stitches. <a href="crochet_hook.html">More...</a>

            <h2>Yarn</h2>
            <p>You can find yarn in a variety of synthetic and natural fibers, like cotton, acrylic, silk,
                and wool. I recommended learning with wool
                or acrylic-blend yarns, because they have a bit more bounce and stretch than cotton yarns.
                For your first few projects, I recommend choosing a smooth,
                medium-weight yarn in a lighter color. <a href="yarn.html">More...</a>

            <h2>Stitch Markers</h2>
            <p>Stitch markers are small tools that you will use to mark your stitches as you crochet. 
                You can use stitch markers
                to mark the beginning of a round, the end of a row, or to keep track of increases and decreases. <a href="stich_markers.html">More...</a>

            <h2>Knitting needles</h2>
            <p>There are five types of knitting needles: straight, circular, interchangeable, 
                double-pointed, and cable. They are usually made of wood, metal, or plastic. Generally 
                speaking, straight needles are
                for flat knitting, DPNs are for knitting in the round, and circular needles are for both. <a href="needles.html">More...</a>
