            <h2>Stitch markers</h2>
                <h3>Circular stitch markers</h3>
                    <p>The circular stitch marker is a loop of some kind that is placed onto your needle in between stitches. It marks a point between 
                        one stitch and the next. This marker sits on the needle just like a stitch. As you work the piece, whenever you come to the stitch marker, you will work the stitch prior to the marker, slip the marker from the left-hand needle
                        to the right-hand needle, and then work the stitch following the marker. In this manner, the stitch marker stays in the same place, between stitches on each row as the knitting progresses. Note: some patterns use the symbol SM or slip marker, and some dont. 
                        If you dont see this note, just slip your markers from one needle to the next as you come to them. More on this laterâ€¦

                <h3>Removable stitch markers</h3>
                    <p>The removable stitch marker, like a safety pin or even a bit of string that you can untie, is used to mark a 
                        stitch itself, or a point in the knitted fabric. It opens up, so it can be attached to a single stitch and left 
                        in the fabric. So as you continue working, and the fabric grows, it ends up far below the row in progress. Sometimes
                         this means you need to remove it and move it up the stitch column as you proceed with your work.
