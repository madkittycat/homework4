                    <h3>Wooden Crochet Hooks</h3>
                        <p>Wooden crochet hooks are made of a wood such as bamboo or a composite of dyed wood 
                            (like our Radiant Crochet Hooks). Wood is warm to the touch and a little slower to slide than aluminum hooks. 
                            They provide a nice earthy feel when you are crocheting, and are a great choice when working with more slippery yarns
                            (especially non-organic fibers like acrylic) because they add some additional grip to keep the yarn from sliding too fast.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Plastic Crochet Hooks</h3>
                        <p>Plastic crochet hooks are often made in brightly-colored plastic. They are inexpensive, readily available,
                            and work with most yarns. Plastic crochet hooks are also lightweight and fairly slippery, and available in many
                            sizes. Most jumbo hooks (commonly used for afghans or rug-making) are made in plastic.
                            Plastic hooks are great for beginners because of the low price and other features; however, they can sometimes have 
                            ridges where the seam of the plastic mold comes together 
                            (no problem, just file it off with a nail file), or they can snap if used with heavy yarn or a tight tension.
                            Plastic crochet hooks low price and light weight make them perfect for travel!
                            </p>
                    <h3>Ergonomic Crochet Hooks</h3>
                        <p>Ergonomic crochet hooks have large handles that are easier to grip, and can reduce the pain
                            associated with yarn crafting. If you experience hand fatigue when crocheting, you may find that an ergonomic
                            crochet hook helps!
